## Yelp Campgrounds
# A personal project to create a site to search for campgrounds using a Yelp API.
A refresher project for me. Going back to the basics of CRUD, REST, and using bootstrap as a shortcut to expedite the styling.
I also realize I do not separate concerns like the routes and models into their own files. This is so I can hammer this project out and move on to the next thing.
