## Campgrounds CRUD
# A personal project to create campgrounds and comment on them using JavaScript and Node.js.
A refresher project for me. Going back to the basics of CRUD, REST, and using bootstrap as a shortcut to expedite the styling.
The functions of this site are:
- Sign up to website
- View all campgrounds
- Create a campground
- Comment on a specific campground
- Edit a campground

Also...
### Authentication 
- Creating campground
- Writing comment
### Authorization
- Editing campground or comment
- Deleting campground or comment

### API
- Added geocoder and google maps api


*This is so I can hammer this project out and move on to the next thing.*
